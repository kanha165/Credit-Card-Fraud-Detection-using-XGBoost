# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-XGBoost
This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the XGBoost algorithm. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so special techniques such as scale_pos_weight and threshold tuning are used to improve fraud detection performance. The project also includes professional data visualizations using Matplotlib
